Welcome to the Srivastava lab! Our lab is set to launch from our home base at <a href="https://wistar.org/">the Wistar Institute</a>, Philadelphia on September 1, 2023. The lab is part of the <a href="https://wistar.org/research-discoveries/ellen-and-ronald-caplan-cancer-center/gene-expression-and-regulation-program#:~:text=The%20Gene%20Expression%20and%20Regulation,in%20cancer%20etiology%20and%20therapeutics.">Gene Expression and Regulation Program</a> at the <a href="https://wistar.org/research-discoveries/ellen-and-ronald-caplan-cancer-center">Ellen and Ronald Caplan Cancer Center</a> of the Wistar Institute.

Our lab seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of how the epigenome regulates transcription to determine cell fate, with a particular emphasis on blood cell development and its dysregulation in leukemia. Our research interests lie at the exciting intersection of epigenetics, computational, and cancer biology. As we strive to achieve our goals, we are assembling a talented team of experimentalists and computational biologists. Together, we plan to harness the power of cutting-edge <u><i>multimodal single-cell technologies</i></u> and <u><i>uncertainty-aware computational models</i></u> to investigate chromatin state activity and its dynamic changes during the intricate process of cell differentiation. Please check our <a href="{{ 'research' | relative_url }}">research</a> page for more details!

Exciting opportunities await as we actively seek to expand our lab at multiple levels. Learn more about our lab's cutting-edge <a href="{{ 'research' | relative_url }}">research</a> and explore our extensive list of <a href="{{ 'publications' | relative_url }}">publications</a>.
