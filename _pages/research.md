Welcome to Srivastava Lab, where our unwavering <u>passion</u> drives us to tackle classical biological problems in modern ways. With a particular focus on employing novel biotechnologies and customized algorithmic solutions, our team of interdisciplinary scientists is committed to delving deep into complex challenges, breaking them down into manageable subproblems, and fostering a collaborative research environment.

Our <u>profession</u> revolves around identifying key biological problems with the potential to make a significant impact. At the forefront of our research lies a comprehensive exploration of how the epigenome regulates transcription, ultimately determining cell fate. Leveraging the power of single-cell biology, we propose computational and technological solutions that pave the way for a deeper understanding of this intricate process.

Yet, our purpose goes beyond theoretical discoveries. Our <u>vocation</u> lies in the application of these proposed solutions to real-world biological problems, especially those pertaining to the chromatin dynamics of blood cell development and its aberration in malignant conditions.

At the core of our endeavors is a steadfast <u>mission</u> to foster a healthier world. With the knowledge of disease mechanisms, we are driven to unlock the secrets behind aberrant conditions. By challenging conventional approaches, we pioneer novel targets and algorithms aimed at correcting and transforming the landscape of disease.

We firmly believe that the convergence of passion, profession, vocation, and mission is the catalyst for meaningful change and we continue to push the boundaries of science under the following three unifying themes of research:
